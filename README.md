# geo-yoots

Tools for working with geometry things

Functions are implemented using spherical trigonometry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_trigonometry, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html)
and vector maths.

## Features

### Distance Functions

Supported objects
1. Point to *point* distance
2. Point to *polyline* distance
3. Point to *circle* distance
4. Point to *polygon* distance

Points are `latitude` and `longitude` pairs. Input/Output units are in kilometers.

#### Point to point

```clojure
;; p1     -> [12.12345 53.54321] => [lat lon]
;; return -> distance

(geo.sphere.distance/to-point p1 p2)
```

#### Point to polyline

```clojure
;; pt                -> [lat lon]
;; polyline-vertices -> [[lat lon] [lat lon] ... ]
;; return            -> distance

(geo.sphere.distance/to-polyline pt polyline-vertices)
```

#### Point to cirlce

```clojure
;; pt     -> [lat lon]
;; center -> [lat lon]
;; radius -> radius
;; return -> distance

(geo.sphere.distance/to-circle pts center radius)
```

#### Point to polygon

```clojure
;; pt               -> [lat lon]
;; polygon-vertices -> [[lat lon] [lat lon] ... ]
;; return           -> distance

(geo.sphere.distance/to-polygon pt polygon-vertices)
```

#### Distance Boolean Functions

Polyline, circle and polygon structures support distance predicates - i.e.
Are input points within `distance` to geometry.

```clojure
(def limit 1.75) ;; kilometers
(geo.sphere.distance/within-distance-to-polyline? limit pts polyline)
```

### Inclusion Tests

#### Point in polygon

*Convex and Non-Convex Simple Polygons*

```clojure
(geo.sphere.impl.inclusion/point-in-polygon? pt plane vertices)
```
